We de\ufb01ne sep- arate associations to capture evaluations which result in speci\ufb01c ac tions, and evaluations which are consequences of some actions. Relationships of Action with other metadata are captured by its association with the Busine ssConcept super-class. The business metadata repository explicitly captures the various d imensions of Zachman framework [Hay99], and even goes beyond the framework by capturing the temporal characteristics of the metadata, and also providing for recording of events, evaluations and actions, which usually have no explicit representatio n in business information systems. The storage of these data provides history of business achieve- ments and decisions. We may contrast this detailed structuring of m etadata with the integraged model of [SMR99] where a single Business Concept cla ss is de\ufb01ned to capture business metadata. 3.3 Linkages with Other Segments The business metadata segment has linkages with the technical met adata and DWH segments of an integrated metadata and data environment. The im portant linkages, as envisaged in our model, are shown in Figure 2. The business entities in the business metadata link with the speci\ufb01cat ion of di- mensions in the technical metadata of the DWH. For instance, an (e xternal) entity Bank (with a suitable set of attributes) can map onto a dimension calle d Bank.

We have captured this linkage with the Dimension metadata class through the association with BusinessConcept clas s. We do not de\ufb01ne any explicit linkage to the Time Dimension. There is an implicit linkage since t he business metadata is temporal. The Time Dimension represents the v alid time line and the calendar de\ufb01ned in the temporal data model. 11 Some business metadata may actually represent the data in the DWH itself. For example, the BankType business entity may have sub-entities Natio nalizedBank, Ru- ralBank, etc. These sub-entities are also de\ufb01ned in the business me tadata repository.

As expressed by Joeris in 1999 [6], the support of heterogeneous processes, flexibility, reuse, and distribution are great challenges for the design of the next generation of process modelling languages and their enactment mechanisms. These process modelling technologies are important for business and can make the management of systems more reactive and efficient. However it is not sufficient to concentrate solely on process management and enactment to solve all the problems identified in EAI in the previous section. If workflow systems are not coupled to a comprehensive data management model, optimum functionalities cannot be realised [7]. Most of recent workflow research has been focused on the enactment and modelling of processes based on Petri nets [8], CORBA [9] or UML concepts [10] however when issues of reconfiguration 1 are considered, these research solutions only provides a high level of workflow control that does not completely address the enterprise problems listed above. The research outlined in this paper proposes an approach that deals with a high level of management of processes with the ability to manage complex data.

To facilitate navigation, we have de\ufb01ned methods to follow various associations a class has. We will illustrate the navigational methods for a few metadata classes. Consider the InternalEntity class. It has the following methods: getSubEntity() : to locate sub-entities of the entity getProcesses() : to obtain process(es) in which the entity is involved getGoals() : to obtain goals related to the entity getA\ufb00ectingEvents() : to obtain external events that a\ufb00ect the entity getActionsTaken() : to obtain actions targeted towards the entity getDimension() : to obtain entity instances (if applicable) stored in the rows of the dimension table. This method navigates from business metadata to D WH. For the Measure class, the following methods support navigation: getGoals() : to obtain goals which use the given measure getEvaluation() : to obtain evaluations based on the measure getFacts() : to obtain fact descriptions on which the measure is based. Similar kind of methods are de\ufb01ned for all the classes in the integrate d repository. These methods permit going from technical metadata to the busine ss metadata and from data in the DWH to the business metadata. Temporal selection is possible with 12 these methods by specifying time interval of interest. Also, the me thodgetHistory() is provided for all temporal classes. This method can be used to obt ain all earlier states (ie, descriptions) of the metadata component. The histor y, given by the past states, indicates evolution of the metadata.

The Need for Integrated Busi ness Process Modelling in EAI In recent years, enterpri ses have been moving from a traditional function-led organisation, addressing the needs of a \u201cvertical\u201d market, to a \u201chorizontal\u201d organisation based on business processes. The emergence of new norms such as the ISO 9001 V2000 and the development of inter-enterprise exchanges are further drivers towards process-led reorganisation. However, currently available information systems and production software are still organised following function models. Consequently, they are not well adapted to the exchange of information between enterprises nor to coping with evolving process descriptions. In modern enterprises organised following a horizontal structur e, industrial EAI solutions are very dependent on process performance and on the ability of the underlying enterprise management to execute and automate the business processes. Furthermore the requirement for the support of enterprise activities is not only for the execution of internal processes but also for external processes, as in the support of supplier- customer relationships especially in supply chain management.

Business systems these days need to be agile to address the needs of a changing world. In particular the discipli ne of Enterprise Application Integration requires business process manage ment to be highly reconfigur able with the ability to support dynamic workflows, in ter-application integration and process reconfiguration. Basing EAI systems on model-re sident or on a so-called description-driven approach enables aspects of flexibility, distribution, system evolution and integration to be addressed in a domain-inde pendent manner. Such a sy stem called CRISTAL is described in this paper with particular emphasis on its application to EAI problem domains. A practical example of the CRISTAL technology in the domain of manufacturing systems, called Agilium, is described to demonstrate the principles of model-driven system evolution and integrat ion. The approach is compared to other model-driven development approaches such as the Model-Driven Architecture of the OMG and so-called Adaptive Object Models. 1. Background and Related Works As the global marketplace becomes increasingly complex and intricately connected, organizations are constantly pr essured to re-organize, re-structure, diversify, consolidate and slim down to provide a winning competitive edge. With the advent of the Internet and e-commerce, the need for coexistence and interoperation with legacy systems and for reduced \u2019times-to-market\u2019, the demand for the timely delivery of flexible software has increased. Couple to this the increasing complexity of systems and the requirement for system s to evolve over potentially extended timescales and the importance of clearly defined, extensible models as the basis of rapid systems design becomes a pre-requisite to successful systems implementation. One of the main drivers in the object-oriented design of information systems is the need for the reuse of design artefacts or models in handling systems evolution. To be able to cope with system volatility, systems must have the capability of reuse and to adapt as and when necessary to changes in requirements. The philosophy that has been investigated in the research reported in this paper is based on the systematic capture of the description of systems elements covering multiple views of the system to be designed (including processes and workflows) using common techniques. Such a description-driven approach [1, 2] involves identifying and abstracting the crucial elements (such as items, processes, lifecycl es, goals, agents and outcomes) in the system under design and creating high-level descriptions of these elements which are stored and managed separately from their instances. Description-driven systems (DDS) make use of so-called meta-objects to store domain-specific system descriptions that co ntrol and manage the life cycles of meta- object instances or domain objects. The separation of descriptions from their instances allows them to be specified and managed and to evolve independently and asynchronously. This",

    "text": "of reifying system descriptions as objects is that op erations can be carried out on them, like composing and editing, storing and retrieving, organizing and reading. Since these meta-objects can represent system descriptions, their manipulation can result in change in the overall system behaviour. As such, reified system descriptions are mechanisms that can lead to dynamically evolvable and reusable systems. Meta- objects, as used in the cu rrent work, are the self-representations of the system describing how its internal elements can be accessed and manipulated. These self- representations are causally connected to th e internal structures they represent i.e. changes to these self-representations imme diately affect the underlying system. The ability to dynamically augment, extend and redefine system specifications can result in a considerable improvement in flexibility. This leads to dynamically modifiable systems, which can adapt and cope with evolving requirements. There are a number of OO design t echniques that encourage the design and development of reusable objects. In particular design patterns are useful for creating reusable OO designs [16]. Design patterns for structural, behavioural and architectural modelling have been well documented elsewhere and have provided software engineers with rules and guidelines that they can (re-)use in software development. Reflective architectures that can dynamica lly adapt to new user requirements by storing descriptive information which can be interpreted at runtime have lead to so- called Adaptive Object Models [17]. These ar e models that provide meta-information about domains that can be changed on the fly. Such an approach, proposed by Yoder, is very similar to the approach adopted in this paper A Description-Driven System (DDS) architecture [1, 2], as advocated in this paper, is an example of a reflective meta-layer (i.e. meta-level and multi-layered) architecture. It makes use of meta-objects to store domain-specific system descriptions, which control and manage the life cycles of meta-object instances, i.e. domain objects. The separation of descriptions from their instances allows them to be specified and managed and to evolve independently and asynchronously. This separation is essential in handling the complexity issues facing many web-computing applications and allows the realization of inter-operability, reusability and system evolution as it gives a clear boundary be tween the application's basic functionalities from its representations and controls.

In constructing detectors like CMS, scientists require data management systems that are able to cope with comp lexity, with system evolution over time (primarily as a consequence of changing us er requirements and extended development timescales) and with system scalability, distribution and interoperation. No commercial products provide the capabilities required by CMS. Consequently, a research project, entitled CRISTAL (Cooperating Repositories and an Information System for Tracking Assembly Lifecycles [4]) has been initiated to facilitate the management of the engineering data collect ed at each stage of production of CMS. CRISTAL is a distributed product data and workflow management system , which makes use of an OO database for its repos itory, a multi-layered architecture for its component abstraction and dy namic object modelling for the design of the objects and components of the system. CRISTAL is based on a DDS architecture using meta- objects. The DDS approach has been followed to handle the complexity of such a data-intensive system and to provide the flexibility to adapt to the changing scenarios found at CERN that are typical of any research production system. In addition CRISTAL offers domain-independence in that the model is generic in concept. Lack of space prohibits further discussion of CRISTAL; detail can be found in [1, 2 & 4]. The design of the CRISTAL prototype was dictated by the requirements for adaptability over extended timescales, for sy stem evolution, for interoperability, for complexity handling and for reusability. In adopting a description-driven design approach to address these re quirements, the separation of object instances from object description instances was needed. This abstraction resulted in the delivery of a three layer description-driven architecture. The model abstraction (of instance layer, model layer, meta-model layer) has been adap ted from the OMG MOF specification [18], and the need to provide descriptive information, i.e. meta-data, has been identified to address the issues of adaptability, complexity handling and evolvability. Figure 3 illustrates the CRISTAL archit ecture. The CRISTAL model layer is comprised of class specifications for CRISTAL type descriptions (e.g. PartDescription) and class specifications for CRISTAL classes (e.g. Part). The instance layer is comprised of object instances of these classes (e.g. PartType#1 for PartDescription and Part#1212 for Part). Th e model and instance layer abstraction is based on model abstraction and on the Is an instance of relationship. The abstraction based on meta-data abstraction and the Is described by relationship leads to two levels - the meta-level and the base level. The me ta-level is comprised of meta-objects and the meta-level model that defines them (e.g. PartDescription is the meta-level model of Part Type#1 meta-object).

The approach of fers a mapping between different business modeling notations which could be used for bridging BM tool s and boosting the MDA approach 1 Modeling Problems An unambiguous and formal method how to describe some probl em has been demanded always. A model of the problem is essential for [1]: \u0001\u0002investigation and analysis, \u0001\u0002unambiguous information exchange between people and computer s ystems, \u0001\u0002development of a practical solution, using the problem mode l. Additionally a model must support measurement and comparison (both for simulation and in real environment), and should support version and change management during the mode l life cycle. To ensure now a successful business, an enterprise must i ntegrate its information systems with partners and make the data exchange available. Today not only a simple data exchange but also more complicated service exchange is already used (e.g. web services and e-business). Howe ver, the demands are even higher \u2013 the business should support not only a simple service at a nar row area, but also any service at any place (e.g. e-government). In order to build such interoperable proces s definitions a notation independent process modeling is of highest value. Currently many business modeling (BM) languages exist and even more tools, which support th em. The most popular ones are ARIS, IDEF3, UML with its Activity Dia gram (AD), GRADE BM (BM) [2]. What refers to UML, its newest (in-progress) version 2.0 [3] is referen ced in this paper. However, these languages mainly support modeling of the business processes themselves, but say nothing or very little about the business process environment and semantics. They don\u2019t answer - why th is process is used, how it is linked to other processes a nd enterprise demands, how we can control and improve it. C ertainly, some of these languages can be used as a framework for modeling the above mentioned higher-level concepts in an indirect way. The question is \u2013 what are general concepts to which we should pay attention to describe all aspects of an enterprise, and which is the best way? Our approach to t his question is metamodel based. We would like to build a metamodel, which would be: \u0001\u0002simple and natural enough to be understood also by non-IT pe ople \u0001\u0002comprehensive enough cover all business aspects which a re more or less related to business processes \u0001\u0002detailed enough to serve the goals of system description, analysis and design, as far as business processes are concerned \u0001\u0002serve as a common basis for the most typical BM nota tions and would enable a more or less automated concept mapping from one notation (modeling language) to ano ther.

[MDC99a] de\ufb01nes metadata as \u2018descriptive information about the st ructure and meaning of data and of the applications and processes that manipula te data\u2019. The metadata has traditionally been classi\ufb01ed into technical and busines s metadata. The technical metadata speci\ufb01es how exactly the data is structured a nd stored in \ufb01les or databases. This metadata allows applications and tools to access an d manipulate the data. The business data, expressed through modeling concepts a nd data constraints, help in understanding the data and their usage. In order to achieve \u2018strategic ad- vantages of on-line access to all knowledge maintained in the distribu ted computing environment of an enterprise\u2019 [MDC99a], a need for a centralized on -line metadata repository has been recognized by researchers (e.g., see [SMR99]) and standards or- ganizations. Such a repository needs to be centrally administered f or e\ufb00ective use by the developers and end-users. While the technical metadata is relatively well-de\ufb01ned, the business m etadata has posed important challenges due to the diversity of information t hat needs to be captured and modeled. (e.g., [OMG99] does not cover business me tadata, and [MDC99a] standards arestill being proposed for addressing some s peci\ufb01c aspects such as Business Engineering Model [MDC99c], Business Rules [MDC99b], and Knowledge Management model [MDC99d]). The Zachman Framework [Hay99] established di\ufb00erent perspective s and dimen- sions for information systems within a 6 x 6 table. The perspectives c over directions and purpose (row 1), and the nature of business, including its stru cture, functions, 2 organization, etc. (row 2). The dimensions include the \u2018what\u2019, \u2018how\u2019, \u2018w here\u2019, \u2018who\u2019, \u2018when\u2019 and \u2018why\u2019 aspects of a perspective. Thus, these two rows c an be considered as de\ufb01ning the business metadata. The row 3 de\ufb01nes information syst em model using data models, process models and business rules. Considering the imp ortance of iden- tifying and specifying the constraints of a business, the IBM user G roup, GUIDE, published a standard for de\ufb01ning business rules [HH97]. The report t akes an in- formation system perspective, where business rules express con straints on creation, updating and removal of persistent data. The report does not co ver many other cat- egories of issues (such as policies, guidelines, processes, work\ufb02ow s, events, etc.).

A business user must 6 be aware of these changes, as the changes may alter the consiste ncy and com- parability of data over time. The meaning of a business concept may c hange, or there may be changes in policies, goals, and processes. While analy zing data in a warehouse, the data must be made consistent and comparable ( by suitable transformations), if possible, and the user must be proactively ma de aware of changesinbusinessmetadata. [BN99]givesmanyexamplesofmetad atachanges for the central bank. For instance, the de\ufb01nition of term \u2018non-pe rforming asset (NPA)\u2019 has changed recently in terms of duration of non-payment of a loan that leads to its classi\ufb01cation as NPA. Thus, the metadata are temporal in nature. Each metadata has a time in- terval of validity. This interval is speci\ufb01ed as beginning from a certa in time instant (called, FROM), and ending at another time instant (called, T O). The description is e\ufb00ective in the real-world during this interval. As an implic ation, the data in the warehouse must also be temporally characterized so that the metadata and data can be temporally co-related. \u2022Metadata Abstraction Levels : The amount of metadata that can b e de\ufb01ned for an organization could be extensive, even if we assume some domain ba ckground amongtheusers. Often, themetadataarenotreadilyavailable(ve ry feworgani- zations even have detailed \u2019operations and procedures\u2019 manuals). Moreover, in many cases, the business users do not need de\ufb01nitions of primitive c oncepts, nor the details of computations and processing. Summary speci\ufb01cation s are often adequate. The detailed speci\ufb01cations can be found, if required, in t he source code of some application. The business metadata can provide a \u2018drill-d own\u2019 into the application code for details of processes. \u2022Integrated Evolution : As business requirements change, the app lication sys- tems need to evolve. The changes may a\ufb00ect database design as we ll as the pro- cessing logic. The requirements change is naturally a consequence o f changes in business policies, goals, processes, rules, etc., and should also res ult in evolution of business metadata.

Inthis section, we formally introduce the data model for metadata, using Uni\ufb01ed Modeling Language (UML)[BRJ99] as the representation language. We use UML class dia gram to represent the business metadata classes and their inter-relat ionships. In UML notation, rectangles represent classes, with class names in the up per part and the main class attributes in the lower part (for clarity, we do not indicate class methods in the diagrams). Inheritance relationship is shown using an arc with a rrow-head pointing to the super-class. Associations are represented by labe led arcs with an \u2019m\u2019 at the ends to represent manytype of associations. The overall metadata model is shown in Figure 2. The \ufb01gure, in fact, shows inte- gration of the business metadata with DWH technical metadata as w ell as warehouse data. The associations across the boundaries of the three segme nts in the integrated model represent the navigational paths between metadata and d ata (in either direc- tion). In the technical metadata segment, we only show the primar y metadata classes used in structuring a warehouse with the purpose to establish impor tant relationships with business metadat. It is not our intention to propose a new mode l for technical metadata. This metadata speci\ufb01cation can use any of the propose d standards, such 8 as OIM [MDC99a] or CWM [OMG99]. The OIM model, for example, uses tec hnical metadata classes such as Dimension, DimHierarchy, Cube, Measure , etc. OIM also allows speci\ufb01cations for transformations, which can describe how d ata from produc- tion databases is transformed before loading data into the DWH. 3.2 Metadata Classes and Associations The business metadata includes a generalized class called Business Co ncept.

Conclusions The combination of a multi-layered meta-modelling architecture and a reflective meta-level architecture resulted in what has been referred to in this paper as a DDS architecture. A DDS architecture, is an example of a reflective meta-layer architecture. The CRISTAL DDS architectur e was shown to have two abstractions. The vertical abstraction is based on the is an instance of relationship from the OMG meta-modelling standard, and has three layers - instance layer, model layer and meta- model layer. This paper has proposed an orthogonal horizontal abstraction mechanism that complements this OMG approach. The horizontal abstraction is based on the meta-level architecture ap proach, encompasses the is described by relationship and has two layers - meta-level and base level. This description-driven philosophy facilitated the design and implementation of the CRISTAL project with mechanisms for handling and managing reuse in its evolving system requirements and served as the basis of the Agilium description-driven workflow system. The model-driven philosophy expounded in this paper is similar to that expounded in the Model Driven Architecture (MDA [18]) of the OMG.

However, the categorization of the business meta- data is fairly general, and applies to most businesses.

These are often qualitative in nature. The monitoring and control functio ns of the departments inthebankhaveexplicit goalsonexchangerates, for eignexchange, interest rates, lending to priority sectors, etc. 5 \u2022Business Entities : an organization deals with many entities, both inte rnal and external.

The examples could include di\ufb00erent type s of banks, non-banking \ufb01nancial institutes, and business sectors. Entities m ay be inter- related, and also associated with goal and other metadata catego ries. \u2022Processes : these describe at some suitable level of details how the business activities are performed. A process may be decomposed into sub-p rocesses, and be associated with other metadata such as functions, goal, busine ss entity, etc. \u2022External Events : these are important happenings (beyond the c ontrol of the organization) which have impact on some metadata, such as Policy an d Func- tions. They may be events which a\ufb00ect business entities directly or in directly (e.g., merger of two banks). \u2022Measures : these are quantitative parameters that measure the e\ufb00ects of busi- ness activities.

The metada ta has been broadly classi\ufb01ed into the business and technical metadata. It is the busine ss metadata which provides appropriate business context for the understanding an d analysis of data and 14 for decision-support. Considering the importanceof metadata, m ajor standardization e\ufb00orts, notably the OIM of MDC [MDC99a] and CWM of OMG [OMG99], hav e been undertaken with primary focus on the technical metadata. The bu siness metadata poses many challenges in terms of scope, abstractions and struct ure. The Zachman framework [Hay99] has provided guidelines, and the Business Engine ering Model pro- posals, covering business goals, organizational elements, busines s processes, business rules and knowledge management, of OIM emerge as a comprehensiv e e\ufb00ort in this direction. In an attempt to build an integrated DWH environment for a central bank, the structuring of business metadata has merged as a major challenge [BN99]. Unlike the integrated model of [SMR99], where all aspects of business are generalized in a singlemetadataclass, calledBusinessConcept, weconsidereditnec essarytoexplicitly structure the business metadata into many categories. The othe r challenges included changes to metadata itself over time, and navigational access bet ween metadata and data in either direction. The integrated metadata and DWH model proposed in this paper eme rged as a solution for the bank\u2019s requirements (although it is clear to us that a few iterations, after the initial implementation and subsequent user feedback, wo uld be necessary to \ufb01ne-tune it). The model achieves integration of the three segmen ts, business meta- data, technical metadata and the DWH, to allow the users to interp ret, understand, access and analyze the data in the DWH, taking into account the tem poral character- istics of both the metadata and data, and then evaluate achieveme nt of business goals andplanfuturebusiness actions. These aretheessential require ments forthebankfor its regulatory and planning functions. Like the most emerging metad ata standards, we use object-oriented modeling using the UML representation. We de\ufb01ne temporal validity for all classes, and navigational methods so that all related metadata and data for any entity can be obtained. The future work consists of \ufb01ne-tuning the model based on the ex perience, and bring it closer to the OIM\u2019s Business Engineering Model (BEM), but at the desired level of abstractions for the application.

As you can see, the above-mentioned metamodels are quite different, yet a more dissimilar view on business concepts is described in [10], where business systems are explored in terms of e-business requirements. One more view on Business Processes is presented by Busines s Process Management Initiative (BPMI) [11], where a business is modeled in terms of its interfaces and coll aboration. Sure, we could list more models - detailed or generic, but the ones mentioned here are enough to show how different the views can be on the same area. 3 Main business concepts and their relations When several sources are combined into one model, the main problem is that similar concepts are named very differently. Therefore, the first step is the analysi s of semantics of concepts, and harmonization to one general concept (e.g., Community and Enterprise ). To support a general business pattern, we choose the Value Added Chain approach - a business of an enterprise is described in t erms of input (the enterprise is supplied with raw materials or \u201craw\u201d service), process (add some value to this) and output (deliver it to customer as a value added service or a processed material)[12]. To make our metamodel as small as possible we paid attent ion only to these aspects, which play some role in business process automation. Such things as competitors or reputation that play big role in business, but are not directly related to business processes, are not included. However, we included such \u201cintangible\u201d thing as Knowledge , addressing that part of the enterprise knowledge, which i s stored as data, especially in knowledge management systems becoming so popular. Also, we tried to exclude as many abstract classes from the model as possible, because they damage the model understandability. For sample, we included real classes Requirement and Conformity , but we didn\u2019t include Quality (a conformity to determined requirements). Quality is shown only as a two-way dependency between these classes. We made an exclusion regarding to the abst ract class Performer . It was introduced due to wish to provide a more general relation to the Task concept. Fig. 3 presents our current proposal for the business metam odel. In the presented model, Business Goal means anything (tasks, goals, plans), that is strategic and for a long term. Business Goal [8] is split into two parts \u2013 Strategy , witch usually is an unstructured information and Index Value \u2013 a measurable magnitude that is used to measure the progress in strategy implementation. Resource and its relation to Enterprise , Input , Output and Business Process is taken from the Value Added Chain approach. The Measurement-Refinement and Determination-Satisfaction chains conform to ISO.

Invariably, an organization has mult iplicity of such systems, each with a speci\ufb01c scope, purpose and functionality. Th e data analysis and decision support systems evaluate business performance against a set of goals, and facilitate new business decisions, policies and goals. The DWH technolo gy [KRRT98] provides tools and techniques for e\ufb03ciently organizing, browsing, q uerying and visu- alizing large amount of historical data for analysis and decision-makin g. The data in a DWH is typically organized either as a \u2018star schema\u2019 or a \u2018multi-dimens ional cube\u2019 consisting of dimensions andfacts or measures . The measures may represent transactional data (aggregated, if necessary) or snapshot da ta. The data in oper- ational systems go through the \u2018ETL step\u2019, where the relevant dat a are extracted, transformed, co-related and \ufb01nally loaded into the warehouse. In today\u2019s dynamic market conditions, organizations are placing mor e emphasis onshorter decision times by reducing organizationalhierarchies an dempowering their 4 \u2018knowledge-workers\u2019. Consequently, a larger number of business u sers need access to data that might cut across the boundaries of organizational units and functions. For them, the business data needs to be readily accessible at the logical level. The techni- cal metadata, primarily meant for the developers, administrators , and the automated tools, is of little direct use for business users. The business metadata, besides a meaningful logical-level descript ion of data, should also include the business context of data: purpose, relevan ce, potential use, past usage, etc. To some extent, such a context can be provided by including in business metadata the speci\ufb01cations relating to the \ufb01rst two rows in the Zachman Framework.

The (not shown) association multiplicities are 0..1 or 1, so me XOR constraints are also shown. Note that the GR ADE Task is a very inclusive concept \u2013 it includes a triggering condition attribute, and according to the values of that attribute ( OR , AND , none ) a task maps to either Merge or Join classes (or none of them) in the independent domain. If either of these classes is present the Incoming transition is also included in the mapping. A similar situation is for the task exit. It should be noted that t he described conditional mapping can be described formally using OCL.

The results obtained so far seem to be promising for bui lding a comprehensive business modeling framework covering most of the known BM notations and extending them. The practical aspect of this approach would be a possibili ty to build a notation independent repository for several simultaneously accessing BM tools using different BM nota tions. Each of the tools internally would \u201clive\u201d upon its native domain metamodel. Additionally this could boos t the MDA approach by providing unambiguous model translations between different modeling notations . References 1 A. Osterwalder, S. Ben Lagha, Y.

The operational systems, also called OLTP systems, are commonly built using commercial DBMS techn ology for e\ufb03cient processing of business transactions. These distributed, function-speci\ufb01c in- formation systems form information \u2018assets\u2019 of the organization. The concept of data warehousing (DWH) has rapidly become popular to leverage the oper ational data for strategic decision making across the whole organization. Data w arehousing is a technology [KRRT98, MVVdf], that provides models, tools and techn iques for build- ing integrated, subject-wise data from the operational systems . It provides \ufb02exible ways to access, aggregate and visualize integrated data (possibly from across di\ufb00erent business functions) based on selected parameters of interest, a nd navigate inside the data \u2018warehouse\u2019 so that business trends can be discovered and u nderstood for better business decisions. Inthecontext oflargenumber ofinformationsystems, designeda ndmaintainedby di\ufb00erent organizational units, operating in heterogeneous compu ting environments, and targeted towards di\ufb00erent business functions, it becomes es sential that ways are found to correctly and consistently understand and co-relat e data from di\ufb00erent sources in terms of formats, meaning and temporal characterist ics of data.

It should be noted that such \u201cplatform independent modeling\u201d is completely in line with the MDA (Model Driven Architecture) approach, extending the platform independent dev elopment to process modeling area. 2 Business Metamodels Business modeling is already a widespread term, however we wish to say that only some views of business have been investigated. At this time unambiguous and well-define d models exist only for several narrow business areas, but wide and comprehensive models are very inform al and generic. For example, a business process as a sequence of activities is well defined in several notat ions, but practically nothing is said about its environm ent. J. Zachman is one of the first, who has investigated enterprise level business aspects. His methodology[5], developed in 1987. and named Zachman Framework , has gained popularity and has been implemented in several modeling tools, including System Architect [6] by Popkin Software. In this framework, several high- level business concepts are introduced - goals, strategy and busin ess plan. These terms are used as a context for concepts, included in model diagrams. Unfortunately, this f ramework is too informal and doesn\u2019t show concept relationships, no metamodeling approach has been used ther e. As e-business spreads more widely, many models have been developed from this prospective. Quite an accurate view was introduced by Andreas Dietzsch [7]. His approach is described by a metamodel \u2013 a class diagram (Fig. 1) therefore it is quite unambiguous. The model shows the b usiness goals and strategy like Zachman framework, but it also introduces input-output chain of an enterprise. Some of the model concepts (supplier, input, business process, output, customer) have a good correlation with th e ISO/DIS standard[8]. This model introduces several types of enterprise processes (management, support, perform ing).
