The model's reasoning content matches the correct option content, as it discusses using OCL for formal descriptions of relationships between elements and creating consistent mappings.\n5. Since both the question and the model use numbers, no conversion is needed. \n\nGiven the perfect match in both choice identifier and content, the confidence in this evaluation is 1.0, and the score is 1, indicating the model's answer is correct.\nCompleted 28/30 questions | Running accuracy: 85.7%\nWarning: Grader returned invalid JSON, attempting to parse response: Here's the evaluation of the model's answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"correct_choice\": \"1\",\n  \"model_choice\": \"1\",\n  \"match\": true,\n  \"confidence\": 1.0,\n  \"score\": 1,\n  \"content_consistent\": true,\n  \"reasoning\": \"The model selected option 1, which directly matches the correct answer choice.
